# (Was) Backend for my blog @ [lolwierd.ml](lolwierd.com)

Uses notion as a CMS for blogs.

Blog frontend is deployed using hugo.

This backend basically fetches posts (with updated property set to true) from a notion database, converts them into markdown and saves the corresponding markdown to the hugo content/posts folder. Hugo can then pick those files up and do its thing.

Direct any and all questions @ me@lolwierd.com or @lolwierrd on twitter.
